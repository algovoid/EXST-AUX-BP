# Universal Digital Exhaust Bypass Flap

This project is a **standalone, digitally controlled exhaust bypass system** for cars. It allows dynamic control over exhaust sound profiles—from stock/silenced to aggressive straight pipe—using a durable, easy-to-install design.

## Features

- **Digital Position Control**  
  GUI-based tool to define flap positions during first setup.

- **H-Pipe Design**  
  Flaps mounted 90° apart to switch between silenced and straight pipe modes, with adjustable positions in between.

- **Durable Hardware**  
  Metal servo used for long-term reliability.

- **Fail-Safe Mechanism**  
  Flaps can be mechanically locked in the silenced position in case of electrical failure—no disassembly required.

- **Compact & Simple Installation**  
  Requires only 2 power wires and a control switch. No external modules or ECU integration needed.
